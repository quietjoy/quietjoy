# Hi👋

I enjoy working on

+ ☀️  resilient systems for off-grid, no-cloud computering fun
+ 🧠 ai training and inference from robots to customer service
+ 🤖 teleop systems for controlling many robots at once

Currently spending most of my professional time on the last one

🔧 I work with Python, Django, WebRTC, and low-level networking

I'm always interested in collaborating with others in the same areas.
