# Hi👋

I enjoy working on

+ ☀️  open source automation and security
+ 🧠 ai training and inference from robots to customer service
+ 🤖 teleop systems for controlling many robots at once

I'm always interested in collaborating with others in the same areas.

🔧 I work with Python, Django, WebRTC, and low-level networking
